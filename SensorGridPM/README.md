# Knight Lab SensorGridPM

Wireless particulate matter monitoring over LoRa networks

This is a version of the SensorGrid project that is specific to montoring
particulate matter data (PM 2.5 and PM 10) and collecting that data over a
LoRa wireless network.


## Development

This code is structured for development in PlatformIO with its entry point set
to enable Arduino IDE compilation as well. See below for information about
compiling with the Arduino IDE.

### Dependencies

See the `lib_deps` section of the `platformio.ini` file

### Arduino IDE

Development is mostly done on PlatformIO (https://platformio.org/) but we do
occasional checks to ensure deployment on Arduino IDE. It should just work.

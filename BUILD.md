# SensorGrid Building Guide

Be sure to take a look at the Planning Guide first. Most relevant information is there. For actual Feather and FeatherWing assembly, please see the Adafruit tutorial:

## Additional notes/tips:

  * Keep your stack planning in mind. Desoldering is much less fun than soldering. If you're not sure what kind of header to use, go with a stacking header for maximum flexibility.

  * When soldering stacking headers, the breadboard trick shown in the Adafruit tutorial does not work so well. Some things that help to keep the headers straight:
    - tack-solder one or two pins and double-check the alignment before doing all the pins
    - it can help to use an already soldered module as a plug-in base to get the spacing and alignment right
    - once a pin or two are soldered, it can be helpful to use the vice. Probably not before that though
    - mostly, I just try to stand my headers up straight and hope for the best. They don't always turn out the greatest though

  * If you are still planning things out, consider wire wrapping instead of soldering where you can get away with it. Not so much for the Feather headers, but, e.g. if you are planning out a new sensor module

  * Some additional prototyping tools that might come in handy:
    - breadboard and jumper wires
    - breadboard terminal blocks
    - specialized Feather terminal (https://www.adafruit.com/products/3173)
    - specialized Feather terminal board (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2926)

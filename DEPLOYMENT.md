## Power

Nodes can be powered by a USB source (e.g. by plugging into a computer USB port), or more commonly by battery.

If USB power is provided with a battery attached, the battery will recharge. However, this recharge will be slow since the node is also being powered. Thus, it is recommended to use a dedicated charger such as Adafruit's USB Lilon/LiPoly charger (https://www.adafruit.com/product/259) or the versitile USB/DC/Solar Lithium Ion/Polymer charger - v2 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/390)

Please use only a single battery attached to a node via the provided battery connector. Improper use of LiPoly batteries can be unsafe. For more information, see Adafruit's excellent introduction to LiPoly batteries:
